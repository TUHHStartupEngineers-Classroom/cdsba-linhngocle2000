The two variables are different types of data, thus they have different ranges. Age has a range from 0 to 99, but income has a range from 0 to 10485. Furthermore, both variables have different measure units. Age is measured in years and income is measured in a type of currency. This makes their standard deviations also to have different unit, thus they are not comparable to each other.\nCovariance, correlation:\n\nCovariance: \\(Cov(age,income) = 29700.15\\)\nCorrelation: \\(Corr(age,income) = 0.5479432\\)\n\n\nBoth the covariance and correlation indicate a positive linear relationship between age and income. In other words, on average, when age increases, income increases proportionally.\n\n# Functions used in R for the computation\n# Covariance\nCovariance &lt;- cov(random_vars[\"age\"], random_vars[\"income\"])\n# Correlation\nCorrelation &lt;- cor(random_vars[\"age\"], random_vars[\"income\"])\n\n\nCorrelation is easier to interpret than covariance. Since correlation is a standardized measure ranges from -1 to 1, one can find out the strength of the relationship between two variables in addition to its direction. The closer the absolute value of correlation is to 1, the stronger the relationship. In contrast, covariance is not a standardized measure, since its values don’t have a specific range. Covariance only provides information to the direction of the relationship.\nConditional expected value\n\n\\(E[income|age&lt;=18] = 389.6074\\)\n\\(E[income|age \\in [18,65)] = 4685.734\\)\n\\(E[income|age&gt;=65] = 1777.237\\)\n\n\n\n# Functions used in R for the computation\n# Expected value of income with age under or equal 18\nE_1 &lt;- mean(unlist(random_vars[random_vars$age &lt;= 18,\"income\"]))\n# Expected value of income with age above or equal 18 AND under 65\nE_2 &lt;- mean(unlist(random_vars[random_vars$age &gt;= 18 & random_vars$age &lt; 65,\"income\"]))\n# Expected value of income with age above or equal 65\nE_3 &lt;- mean(unlist(random_vars[random_vars$age &gt;= 65,\"income\"]))"

Numbers can be represented as different data types. Whole numbers have integer data types, while decimal numbers are represented as numeric data types. Strings are represented as character data types and can store not only letters,symbols or sentences but also numbers. Strings must be enclosed in single or double quotes.\nThe factors that are relevant for the pricing of a car are: car width, engine size, stroke, peak rpm. These four factors are statistically significant at different levels of \\(\\alpha\\) (\\(\\alpha = 0\\) and \\(\\alpha = .001\\)), meaning there is a correlation between the independent variables (carwidth, enginesize, stroke, peakrpm) and the dependent variable price.\n\n\n# Functions used in R for the task\nlm_car_prices &lt;- lm(price ~ ., data = car_prices)\nlm_summary &lt;- summary(lm_car_prices)\n\n\nChosen regressor: peakrpm\n\nThe regressor has integer data type. The values of peakrpm are positive whole numbers without a decimal point.\nAn increase of one unit in peakrpm is related to an \\(2.416\\) increase in price.\nThe above mentioned effect is statistically significant, since the respective p-value is lower than the significance level \\(\\alpha = 0\\).\n\nI get NA as coefficient for the new variable seat_heating. This is due to the fact that some of the assumptions for a linear regression to deliver valid results are not fulfilled since the variable only takes on one unique value. The linearity, homoscedasticity and normality conditions are not fulfilled, since the variable doesn’t provide any variability for the regression model. Due to this lack of information and variability, R cannot find any relationship between independent and dependent variable when performing linear regression.\n\n\n# Functions used in R for the task\ncar_prices &lt;- car_prices %&gt;% mutate(seat_heating = TRUE)\nlm_car_prices &lt;- lm(price ~ ., data = car_prices)\nlm_summary &lt;- summary(lm_car_prices)"
