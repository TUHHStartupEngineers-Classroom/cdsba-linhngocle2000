# Probability Tree

## Assignment I

* $P(T \cap S) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06$

* $P(T \cap \bar{S}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.6 = 0.42$

* $P(\bar{T} \cap S) = 0.3 \cdot 0.8 = 0.24$

* $P(\bar{T} \cap \bar{S}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.4 = 0.28$

* $P(T \cap S) + P(T \cap \bar{S}) + P(\bar{T} \cap S) + P(\bar{T} \cap \bar{S}) = 0.06 + 0.42 + 0.24 + 0.28 = 1$

# Set Theory

## Assignment II

* The percentage of customers using all three devices is $0.5\%$.

* The percentage of customers using at least two devices is $19.9\%$.

* The percentage of customers using only one device is $80.1\%$.

# Bayes Theorem

## Assignment III

* $P(\bar{A}|B) = \frac{0.01*(1-0.04)}{0.97*0.04+0.01*(1-0.04)} = 0.198$

* $P(A|B) = \frac{0.97*0.04}{0.97*0.04+0.01*(1-0.04)} = 0.802$
